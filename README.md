# Julia Function Error: Missing Return Statement

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia: a function missing a return statement in all code paths.  The `bug.jl` file shows the erroneous code, which leads to an `UndefVarError`. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.jl`, addresses this by including a return statement for all possible scenarios.
